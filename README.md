## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with wapSewap, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/emhaihsan/wapSwap.git
cd wapSwap
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On the same terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with wapSewap features:

- **DEX**: Swap WSP and sUSDC tokens
- **NFT Gallery**: Mint, list, and trade NFTs
- **Faucet**: Get free testnet tokens

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/app`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## Deploy Contracts to Lisk Sepolia

To deploy contracts to Lisk Sepolia testnet, follow the steps below:

1. Get Lisk Sepolia ETH from the [Lisk Faucet](https://faucet.lisk.com/)

2. Inside the `packages/hardhat` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

   ```bash
   cd packages/hardhat && cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables:

   ```bash
   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY = "your_private_key_with_lisk_sepolia_ETH";
   LISK_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL = "https://rpc-sepolia.lisk.com";
   ```

4. Deploy to Lisk Sepolia:

   ```bash
   yarn deploy --network liskSepolia
   ```

   This command deploys all smart contracts to Lisk Sepolia testnet. If the deployment is successful, you will see the deployment tx hash on the terminal.

## Environment Variables

For NFT functionality, you need to configure Pinata IPFS:

1. Create a free account at [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/)
2. Get your JWT token from Pinata dashboard
3. Add to `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT = "your_pinata_jwt_token";
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY = "your_alchemy_api_key";
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID = "your_walletconnect_project_id";
   ```
